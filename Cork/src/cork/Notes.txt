Currently done:
- Creates board
- Pieces move around (coords follow <x,y>)
- Verifies:
	- Move was made by a piece, not an empty space
	- Move is in the bounds of the board prior to getting the data for the move
	- Move is allowed for that piece
	- Move doesn't have any pieces along the way and no allied piece at
	    the destination.

-------------
In progress:
- Fix the pawn movement
- Check for checks and checkmates
- Add more niche rules like move limits, castling,
    and en passant

-------------
Needs:
- A.I. move generation
